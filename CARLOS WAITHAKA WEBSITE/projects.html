      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Projects and achievements are more than just milestones — they represent personal growth, discipline, and vision. 
        This section is a record of my journey in developing practical skills, earning professional certifications, 
        and contributing to my long-term dream of becoming a competent and impactful Business Information Technology professional. 
        From programming exercises to leadership certifications, each step reflects my desire to learn, improve, and inspire others.

      <h2>Certificates and Achievements</h2>

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Python Programming Certificate – UniAthena</h3>
        <p>
          This was my first major step into the world of programming. I successfully completed a <strong>Python Programming Certificate</strong> from <em>UniAthena</em>, 
          an international learning platform. This course taught me the fundamentals of programming, including variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. 
          The certificate gave me confidence and validated my skills as I transitioned from a beginner to someone capable of solving real problems using code.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Leadership Certificate – UniAthena</h3>
        <p>
          Leadership is not just about positions, but about influence, vision, and service. Through the <strong>Leadership Certificate</strong> from <em>UniAthena</em>, 
          I learned essential principles of leading teams, motivating people, and making effective decisions. 
          The knowledge I gained here strengthens the leadership experiences I had in secondary school as Class Prefect, Deputy Captain of Academics, 
          and Head of the Journalism Club. This certificate aligns with my goal of becoming a leader in both technology and business fields.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Communication Skills Certificate – BrighterMonday</h3>
        <p>
          Communication is one of the most valuable skills in life and in the workplace. 
          Through the <strong>Communication Skills Certificate</strong> awarded by <em>BrighterMonday</em>, 
          I polished my ability to express ideas clearly, listen actively, and engage in professional dialogue. 
          This training has not only improved my confidence in public speaking but also enhanced my writing and interpersonal communication — skills 
          that continue to serve me in university and in personal projects.

      <h2>Practical Projects</h2>

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Python Learning Journal</h3>
        <p>
          As I learned programming basics, I created a <strong>Python Learning Journal</strong>. 
          This digital record captures the concepts I studied — such as input/output, conditionals, loops, and functions — 
          along with small programs I wrote. The journal acts as my "progress tracker," motivating me to keep improving 
          and providing proof of consistency. It is a personal initiative that reflects my determination and commitment to coding.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Personal Budget Tracker</h3>
        <p>
          My first functional Python project was a <strong>Personal Budget Tracker</strong>. 
          The program allows users to input their income and expenses, calculate balances, and view summaries of spending. 
          Although simple, it demonstrates how code can solve everyday problems. 
          I am working to improve the project by adding categories, data visualization, and the ability to save records in files or a database. 
          Eventually, I hope to publish it on GitHub as my first public project.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Carlos Personal Website</h3>
        <p>
          This website is itself a project — a space where I can share my story, education, projects, and spiritual journey. 
          It began with basic HTML and CSS, and as I grow my skills, I plan to enhance it with JavaScript, interactivity, and eventually 
          database-driven content. The website symbolizes my courage to start small while keeping a big vision for the future.
        </p>

      <h2>Future Projects & Ambitions</h2>
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Business Information System</h3>
        <p>
          A project to help small and medium-sized businesses manage inventory, sales, and customer relationships. 
          The idea is to create a simple, affordable system that empowers entrepreneurs to be more efficient and competitive.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Spiritual Journey App</h3>
        <p>
          Combining faith and technology, I envision an application that supports Bible reading plans, prayer reminders, 
          and personal sermon note-taking. It will be a digital companion for people pursuing their spiritual growth, 
          just as I am on my journey to complete the Bible by the end of 2025.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Data Analytics Dashboard</h3>
        <p>
          With the skills I will gain in BBIT and Computer Science, I plan to build a <strong>Data Analytics Dashboard</strong> 
          that can process financial and business data. By integrating Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib, 
          I aim to present data in meaningful visualizations to support decision-making in organizations.
        </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        From certificates that validated my skills, to projects that tested my creativity, and to ambitious plans for the future, 
        my journey is just beginning. Each project is a story of effort, learning, and vision. 
        I am not only building skills but also shaping a future where technology and leadership intersect. 
        With faith, determination, and continuous learning, I believe my projects will grow into innovations 
        that create value for people and communities.
