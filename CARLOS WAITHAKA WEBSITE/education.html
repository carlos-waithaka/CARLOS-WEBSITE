      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Education has been the cornerstone of my personal development and the guiding light that has shaped my values, ambitions, and worldview. 
        From my earliest days in daycare to my current pursuit of a university degree, every stage has contributed uniquely to who I am today. 
        This journey has not only sharpened my intellect but also instilled discipline, resilience, leadership, and the courage to embrace challenges.

      <h2>Early Childhood: Kahuho Daycare</h2>
      <p>
        My educational path began humbly at <strong>Kahuho Daycare</strong>. Though only a toddler, this stage planted the seeds of curiosity. 
        The daycare environment was nurturing, full of songs, stories, and playful exercises that awakened in me the joy of learning. 
        Here I learned essential social skills such as sharing, playing in groups, and expressing myself openly. 
        While my memories are faint, I credit this early environment with developing my confidence to face structured education later on.

      <h2>Primary Education: Aida Star Academy (Standard 1–4)</h2>
      <p>
        My lower primary education began at <strong>Aida Star Academy</strong> in Kitale. It was a school full of energy, discipline, and ambition. 
        The structured lessons in English, Mathematics, Science, and Kiswahili gave me a solid foundation. 
        Beyond academics, Aida Star introduced me to cultural activities and creative arts. I vividly remember the dedication of teachers who demanded discipline, punctuality, and academic excellence. 
        The friendships I made during these years were marked by innocence and teamwork. Aida Star was where I first discovered my potential to excel academically and socially.

      <h2>Upper Primary: Lodwar Mixed Primary School (Standard 5–8)</h2>
      <p>
        After relocating, I joined <strong>Lodwar Mixed Primary School</strong>, where my academic and leadership journey deepened. 
        The transition was not easy—new environment, new classmates, and different teaching styles. Yet, this challenge made me more adaptable. 
        At Lodwar Mixed, I was entrusted with the role of <em>School Speaker</em>, an opportunity that nurtured my communication and public speaking skills. 
        Balancing leadership with academics taught me responsibility and time management. 
        In 2019, I sat for my KCPE exams and scored <strong>306 out of 500</strong>. Though the results were modest compared to my ambitions, they reflected hard work and resilience in a demanding environment.

      <h2>Secondary Education: Limyoungsim Goodpeople Mission School</h2>
      <p>
        My secondary education was first directed to <strong>St. Joseph High School</strong>, where I had initially been called. However, my path took a different turn, and I instead joined 
        <strong>Limyoungsim Goodpeople Mission School</strong>, a decision that turned out to be transformative. 
        From Form 1 to Form 4, I experienced rigorous academics, strict discipline, and diverse extracurricular opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time here, I served as <em>Class Prefect</em>, <em>Deputy Captain of Academics</em>, and <em>Head of the Journalism Club</em>. 
        These roles built my leadership, teamwork, and organizational skills. The Journalism Club in particular allowed me to explore writing, public speaking, and creativity. 
        I also learned the importance of resilience—navigating teenage challenges, handling peer pressure, and preparing for the KCSE exams with determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2023, I successfully completed my secondary education with a <strong>B Plain</strong>. 
        The result was a testament to years of discipline and commitment, and it opened doors to higher education.

      <h2>Higher Education: University of Embu</h2>
      <p>
        In 2025, I joined the <strong>University of Embu</strong> to pursue a <em>Bachelor of Business Information Technology (BBIT)</em>. 
        This marked the beginning of a new era in my educational journey, where passion for technology meets the strategic insights of business. 
        At university, I aspire not only to excel academically but also to build practical skills through projects, research, and collaborations. 
        It is here that I hope to refine my vision of becoming a professional who bridges the gap between business and technology while also nurturing leadership skills that will allow me to impact society positively.

      <h2>Reflections on My Educational Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Looking back, my educational journey is not simply about schools attended or grades achieved. It is about the shaping of character, the lessons from failures, 
        the pride in achievements, and the resilience built through transitions. From Kahuho Daycare to the University of Embu, each stage has left a permanent mark. 
        I have learned that education is not a destination but a lifelong process of discovery, growth, and transformation. 
        As I move forward, I remain committed to using my knowledge to create solutions, uplift communities, and honor the sacrifices of my family—especially my mother, 
        <strong>Joyce Nduta Njuguna</strong>, who has been the backbone of my success.
